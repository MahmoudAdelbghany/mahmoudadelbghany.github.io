Yo, welcome to my corner of the internet 

this is less of a blog and more of a digital notebook where I dump everything random that I learn or projects that I start (and probably won't finish, but who knows?).  

## Who Am I?

- **Name:** Mahmoud Abdelghany  
- **Age:** 22  
- **Location:** Egypt ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¬  
- **Education:** Final year of Computer Engineering at Suez Canal University.  

Right now, I am into embedded systems and low-level insanity.  

## What to Expect Here

Expect brain dumps on:  
- Embedded systems experiments.  
- Random tech rabbit holes I fall into.  
- Projects Iâ€™m tinkering with (or abandoning halfway).  
- Occasionally, some rambling about music, politics, or just life.  

If anything I post turned useful for some random anon out there, dope!.

Anyway, this blog is just a way for me to stay sane, keep track of my chaos, and maybe connect with other nerds on the internet. Stay curious, and letâ€™s see where this goes.  

Salamalekum.
